Introduction
============
Welcome to CrazyOS's documentation. Much like the project, this documentation is a work in progress.

Motivation: Why reinvent the wheel?
-----------------------------------
The reason why I am developing my own operating system can be best explained by a few lines which I read in *Just for fun* by Linus Torvalds. 

*"These days, computers suffer from
the same problem as cars: As they became more complex, they
became more difficult for people to take apart and put back
together, and, as a result, learn what they are all about. When was
the last time you did anything on your car more involved than
changing the oil filter?"*

This is exactly the reason why I am trying to make my own operating system: to know what's under the hood and share the discoveries/re-discoveries I made with other people. In my opinion, this type of knowledge is critical for maintaining the systems. An example would be developers who are paid thousands of bucks for maintaining software written in COBOL for various big banks and organisations. 

So, to summarize, the reasons behind building our own operating system are:

1. To understand the machine better

2. Because it is fun

I mean, who wouldn't be inspired to take on this ultimate challenge after learning about personalities like Linus Torvals, Terry A. Davis, and Tim Paterson.

Purpose
-------
Our purpose is to build an operating system from scratch for various architectures, starting with 8086. Later, we will develop operating systems for i386, x86-64, ARM and RISC-V architectures. This operating system (whole family of Crazy OS) would be based on Unix. They will all start as toys, because that is the best way to know about machine. Once the toy is good enough (not neccessarily stable :-)), we will sand it till it becomes a sick cousin of Unix.

Structure of this documentation
-------------------------------
This the biggest project that I have ever attempted. This is clear from the number and types of commits I have made to the project. Naturally, this documentation much like the project would be scattered all over the place, but we hope that with time all of this will evolve into something beautiful. 

Do note that I have not taken pains to explain stuff like little-endian or what BIOS is, because if I do start explaining such things, then I will go off on a tangent and might not possibly return to the topic I originally intended to talk about. You don't understand something? Google it out! Remember what Silivinus Thompson said: 

*"What one fool can do, another can."*
