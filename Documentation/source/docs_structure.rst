Structure of this documentation 
===============================

This the biggest project that I have ever attempted. This is clear from the number and types of commits I have made to the project. Naturally, this documentation much like the project would be scattered all over the place, but we hope that with time all of this will evolve into something beautiful. 

Do note that I have not taken pains to explain stuff like little-endian or what BIOS is, because if I do start explaining such things, then I will go off on a tangent and might not possibly return to the topic I originally intended to talk about. You don't understand something? Google it out! Remember what Silivinus Thompson said: 

*"What one fool can do, another can."*
