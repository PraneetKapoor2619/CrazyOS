## An operating system made because it's fun  
  
Developing my own operating system is a project that I wanted to do as a kid. Now, with the half-cooked knowledge that I have, I think I can make one. I am aiming at making a clone of UNIX, but as that has already been done before, this is just a silly little re-invention of cogs and wheels. Hence the name __Crazy__OS.  
I am learning many things as I go, so anybody who is reading this should not expect this to be a finished product like Linux or MINIX. I am working on this because IT IS FUN!! I love hardware and I love tinkering with it, be it with a soldering iron or using software. So, as one would have guessed it by now, this operating system would not be portable (maybe in the future, but with a one-man army, I don't think portability is conceivable).
I am aiming at making this operating system work on:  
1. IBM PC with 8086  
2. i386  
3. x86-64 (long mode)  
4. ARM (Raspberry Pi)  
5. RISC-V  
  
Much of the testing would be done on emulators like Qemu. For emulating IBM PC, I am using _PCem v17_. If you will download it from the official webpage and try to run it, you will see an error message will come up and say "No ROMs present!". I was able to fix this by following [a video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/dOD1wwtfrjY). To spare others of going through this trouble of copy-pasting stuff, I have uploaded the whole PCem deal I am using. Just download that folder and you would be good to go.  
Finally, I would absolutely love it if someone teaches me a thing or two. So feel free to test and criticize this operating system and talk about it!
That's about it!!
