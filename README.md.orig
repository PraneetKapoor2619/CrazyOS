# CrazyOS 
## An operating system made because it's fun  
  
Developing my own operating system is a project that I wanted to do as a kid. Now, with the half-cooked knowledge that I have, I think I can make one. I am aiming at making a clone of UNIX, but as that has already been done before, this is just a silly little re-invention of cogs and wheels. Hence the name _Crazy_ OS.  
I am learning many things as I go, so anybody who is reading this should not expect this to be a finished product like Linux or MINIX. I am working on this because IT IS FUN!! I love hardware and I love tinkering with it, be it with a soldering iron or using software. So, as one would have guessed it by now, this operating system would not be portable (maybe in the future, but with a one-man army, I don't think portability is conceivable).
I am aiming at making this operating system work on:  
1. IBM PC with 8086  
2. i386  
3. x86-64 (long mode)  
4. ARM (Raspberry Pi)  
5. RISC-V

Much of the testing would be done on emulators like Qemu.

__NOTE: PCem is no longer being used for testing. I have tried two approaches to print hex-numbers using Amstrad PC emulators provided over there. None of them worked and time was wasted. On the other hand, both subroutines (for printing hex) work just fine in Qemu. Probably in future I will use PCem again, but at present, NO!!__ 
Finally, I would absolutely love it if someone teaches me a thing or two. So feel free to test and criticize this operating system and talk about it!
That's about it!!
